== Changelog ==
= 2.4.3 =
- **Onboarding for the new plugin users.** Ecwid plugin now displays new helpful messages when you set up your store and configure the setting. The messages guide the new users through the setup process and provide helpful tips and recommendations.
- **Improvements in the plugin settings pages and messages.** We updated the texts and styles of the messages displayed on the settings pages. They became clearer and more user-friendly.
- **Minor optimizations for search engines** including tidying up of the product pages 'meta' descriptions tags and fixing potential issues in compatibility with Yoast SEO plugin. This is to ensure better indexation and appearing of your products in the search results.
- **Several minor fixes and enhancements**

= 2.4.2 =
- Minor issue is fixed on the plugin's "General settings" page

= 2.4.1 =
- Added compatibility with the new versions of "Google XML Sitemaps" plugin (v4.0 and higher)

= 2.4 =
- **Ability to add a single product to a page or post on your site using new [ecwid\_product] shortcode.** In addition to embedding a whole product catalog on your Wordpress site, you can also feature a single product on a separate page or blog post of your site and allow your customers to purchase the product right from that page. To embed a product on a page or post, add [ecwid\_product id="12345"] shortcode to the page/post in your Wordpress backend. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID.

- **Better SEO for store pages.** Ecwid plug-in now automatically adds product attributes to SEO-optimized versions of product pages on your site to let the search engines index attributes like UPC, brand and others along with the other product properties. Also, some improvements were applied to the format of product HTML snippets to meet the Google recommendations on how to better organize product information (title, descriptions, price etc) on the product details pages. These improvements will help search engines to better index your products and optimize their appearance in search results. 

- **Slight improvements of store layout for mobile devices.** All Ecwid stores are mobile-friendly by design, i.e. they adapt themselves to the given layout and look good on mobile devices, so if your site is mobile-optimized, your Ecwid store will be as well. Earlier, if you use horizontal categories widget on your Wordpress site, you might notice that it didn't fit the given width on narrow screens, e.g. when opened on a mobile device. Now, the plugin automatically hides horizontal categories widget on narrow screens to ensure better look on mobile-optimized sites.

- **Several improvements and bug fixes for plugin settings pages, store appearance and SEO.**

= 2.3.2 =
- **Fixed an issue in sitemap functionality**. Ecwid uses third party plugin to generate an XML sitemap (Google XML Sitemaps) for store products and categories. The current integration had a bug which caused an error message in Wordpress admin backend for users on Free Ecwid plan. Now it's fixed and everything should work OK.

= 2.3.1 =
- Automatic generation of the rel="canonical" links for SEO. Canonical links are aimed to specify the preferred (canonical) URL of the web page for search engines to prevent possible duplicate content issues. Ecwid plugin now generates such links automatically for product and categories pages in your store to provide search crawlers with well-structured content and help them better index your store.
- Improved compatibility with CloudFlare Rocket Loader. The merchants who use CloudFlare Rocket Loader extensions on their sites might previously experience issues with loading of their Ecwid stores. We've further improved the plugin code to prevent such issues in the future. Now Ecwid plugin should perfectly work with CloudFlare extensions.
- Several minor fixes and enhancements

= 2.3 =
- Added compatibility with Google XML Sitemaps plugin. Now you can submit your store items links along with the other site pages to search engines.  To use this feature, please install the "Google XML Sitemaps" plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/), generate a sitemap (it will include your products and categories links) and submit it to the search engines to help them better crawl and categorize your site.

- Improved compatibility with SEO Ultimate plugin. Ecwid plugin always displays your store pages in a proper SEO-friendly format to make the store indexable by search engines. Moreover, we constantly adjust the plugin to make it work fine with popular third party SEO modules. So Ecwid is perfectly compatible with "Wordpress SEO by Yoast", "All in one SEO Pack", "Platinum SEO Pack" and now with "SEO Ultimate" plugin.

- Minor design improvements of the plugin settings pages to make them mobile-friendly for better compatibility with the backend layout of new Wordpress versions. Now you can manage Ecwid plugin settings in your Wordpress administrator panel using your mobile device.

- New "Ecwid badges" widget is available. If you like Ecwid and want to help it grow and become the most popular e-commerce solution, you can now add a fancy 'Powered by Ecwid' badge on your site to show your visitors that you're a proud user of Ecwid. Please find the new widget under 'Appearance → Widgets' section in your Wordpress backend.

= 2.0 =

  - <title> tags for categories. The SEO category pages in your store now include both title and description tags so they will appear in Google search results properly.

- **Smooth HTTP/HTTPS switch**: Ecwid always transfers all sensitive data using secure HTTPS connection and a special 'HTTPS' option in the Ecwid plugin settings is not necessary anymore. Now, the plugin detects connection type and adjust Ecwid integration codes automatically. No manual adjustments are needed regardless of whether you run your site under HTTP or HTTPS.

- **Improved compatibility with CloudFlare Rocket Loader**: previously, using CloudFlare Rocket Loader along with Ecwid might cause intermittent loading issues for some stores. We've improved the plugin code to prevent such issues.

= 1.8.1 =
- [!] Fixed meta title tag display issue on the main store page appeared with the version 1.8 : in some cases, the store page title tag was stripped. Now it should work OK.

- [+] Ability to display separate categories on separate pages with custom shortcodes. Now, the plugin allows setting different default categories for different store pages. So if you have multiple store pages and want to display specific categories on them, you can set up a default category for each of them in the [ecwid\_productbrowser] shortcode like this: [ecwid\_productbrowser default\_category\_id="12345"] . On the other hand, if you have one store page, you can set the default category on the plugin settings page as usual.
- [+] A few more SEO improvements:
   - Product browser's default category ID setting is now taken into consideration by SEO part of the plugin. If you have multiple store pages displaying specific categories of your shop, search engines will index those pages starting from the proper category (not from the store's root)
   - <meta fragment="!"> tag is now displayed on every page where [ecwid\_productbrowser] tag is added so search engines will better index each store page
